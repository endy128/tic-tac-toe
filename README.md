# Tic Tac Toe

JavaScript Tic Tac Toe game

Creating the board, squares etc all in JavaScript, only minimal HTML to begin with

Using: 
- Revealing modular pattern
- Closures
- Function factory
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), as practice in this case


Potentially trying to set up some AI (we will see how it goes :-)
